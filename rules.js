            Welcome to this server.
            Here are some rules that you should follow if you want to be in this server.

            1. Don\'t be racist. 
            Please do NOT be racist towards any caste, person or religion\.

            2. No bullying -
            know it\'s not intended many times but this is something that I will not tolerate. This is a real offence, and no one should do that unless they want to be in trouble.

            3. No unnecessary pings. 
            Look, I know sometimes you do it for fun, or when you are bored or something but unless the shit is serious, pinging will not result in a good way. 

            4. You can say profanities in here, just not too much you edgelords. 

            5. Have fun! Let\'s create a sweet ducking community and have fun. 

            6. Also, please don\'t fucking spam. It\'s annoying and rather idiotic. 

            If you want to talk to me then call or text me.

            7.Discord TOS and Common sense applies, so please follow them too. 

            8. No NSFW stuff, if you dare send that stuff in here, you will get instant ban hammer. Infact, I won\'t even read your ban appeal.

            9. No pornography of any kind - Go to Church you horny devils.

            10. Pinging and Mentions-I get that it\'s un-intentional sometimes, but pinging without a valid reason will not be tolerated.

            11. No, I will not tolerate it if you are being mean to any staff member or me. 

            12. If you know me irl, please respect my privacy!

            13. I have final say in everything, I get to choose and manage stuff.

            14. If any staff is abusing their powers, DM Me or Anatidaeophobia.

            15. No tragedic references, jokes and comments.

            16. Please respect me and my wishes. I get that it\'s un-intentional sometimes, but hurting me in any way will result in a permanent ban.`
